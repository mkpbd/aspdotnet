    /*****

     * This code defines the three key concepts and entities in the domain of the pet store: pets, customers, and orders. The classes are named using the vocabulary of the domain, and the relationships between the classes are defined. The behavior of the classes is not implemented in this example, but it could be implemented in a way that is consistent with the domain.

        This is just a simple example of how DDD could be used to develop a software system for a pet store. By following the steps outlined above, you can implement DDD in C# code to create robust and maintainable software systems.
