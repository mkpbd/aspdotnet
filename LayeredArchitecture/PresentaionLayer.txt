Presentation Layer
The presentation layer,  implements the program’s user interface
for interactions with its consumers. In the pattern’s original form, this layer denotes a
graphical interface, such as a web interface or a desktop application.
In modern systems, however, the presentation layer has a broader scope: that is, all
means for triggering the program’s behavior, both synchronous and asynchronous.

• Graphical user interface (GUI)
• Command-line interface (CLI)
• API for programmatic integration with other systems
• Subscription to events in a message broker
• Message topics for publishing outgoing events


All of these are the means for the system to receive requests from the external environment
and communicate the output. Strictly speaking, the presentation layer is the
program’s public interface.
