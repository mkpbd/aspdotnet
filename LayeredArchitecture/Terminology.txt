Elsewhere, you may encounter other terms used for the layered architecture:
• Presentation layer = user interface layer
• Service layer = application layer
• Business logic layer = domain layer = model layer
• Data access layer = infrastructure layer


To eliminate confusion, I present the pattern using the original terminology. That
said, I prefer “user interface layer” and “infrastructure layer” as these terms better
reflect the responsibilities of modern systems and an application layer to avoid confusion
with the physical boundaries of services.
