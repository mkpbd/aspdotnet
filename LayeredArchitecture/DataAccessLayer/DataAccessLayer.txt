The data access layer provides access to persistence mechanisms. In the pattern’s original
form, this referred to the system’s database. However, as in the case of the presentation
layer, the layer’s responsibility is broader for modern systems.

First, ever since the NoSQL revolution broke out, it is common for a system to work
with multiple databases. For example, a document store can act as the operational
database, a search index for dynamic queries, and an in-memory database for
performance-optimized operations.

Second, traditional databases are not the only medium for storing information. For
example, cloud-based object storage2 can be used to store the system’s files, or a message
bus can be used to orchestrate communication between the program’s different
functions

Finally, this layer also includes integration with the various external information providers
needed to implement the program’s functionality: APIs provided by external
systems, or cloud vendors’ managed services, such as language translation, stock market
data, and audio transcription
