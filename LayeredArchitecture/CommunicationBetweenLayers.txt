The layers are integrated in a top-down communication model: each layer can hold a
dependency only on the layer directly beneath it. This enforces
decoupling of implementation concerns and reduces the knowledge shared
between the layers    the presentation layer references only the business
logic layer. It has no knowledge of the design decisions made in the data access layer.
