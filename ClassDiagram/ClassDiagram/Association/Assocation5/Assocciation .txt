Requirement 2 is an interesting requirement (Manager uses a swipe card to enter XYZ premises).
 In this requirement, the manager object and swipe card object use each other but they have their own object lifetime.
 In other words, they can exist without each other. The most important point in this relationship is that there is no single owner.



The above diagram shows how the "SwipeCard"   class uses the "Manager" class and the "Manager" class uses the "SwipeCard" class. 
You can also see how we can create the object of the "Manager" class and "SwipeCard" independently and they can have their own object lifetime.
 
This relationship is called the "Association" relationship.
