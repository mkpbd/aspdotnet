1.	Connect to the Database
2.	Prepare an SQL Command
3.	Execute the Command
Retrieve the results and display them in the application
And this is possible with the help of .NET Data Providers.


The point that you need to remember is depending on the provider, the ADO.NET objects (Connection, Command, DataReader, and DataAdapter) have a different prefix as shown below.

1. Connection – SQLConnection, OracleConnection, OleDbConnection, OdbcConnection, etc.
2. Command – SQLCommand, OracleCommand, OleDbCommand, OdbcCommand, etc.
3. DataReader – SQLDataReader, OracleDataReader, OleDbDataReader, OdbcDataReader, etc.
4. DataAdapter – SQLDataAdapter, OracleDataAdapter, OleDbDataAdapter, OdbcDataAdapter, etc.

DataSet:
The DataSet object in ADO.NET is not Provider-Specific. Once you connect to a database, execute the command, and retrieve the data into the .NET application. 
The data can then be stored in a DataSet and work independently of the database. So, it is used to access data independently from any data source. 
The DataSet contains a collection of one or more DataTable objects.

============================= What is ADO.NET DataSet in C#? =============================
What is ADO.NET DataSet in C#?
The DataSet represents a subset of the database in memory. That means the ADO.NET DataSet is a collection of data tables that contains the relational data in memory in tabular format.

It does not require a continuous open or active connection to the database. The DataSet is based on the disconnected architecture. This is the reason why it is used to fetch the data without interacting with any data source. We will discuss the disconnected architecture of the data set in our upcoming articles.

Note: The ADO.NET DataSet class is the core component for providing data access in a distributed and disconnected environment. The ADO.NET DataSet class belongs to the System.Data namespace.

Signature of DataSet in C#:
The signature of the DataSet class is shown in the below image.





DataSet(): It initializes a new instance of the System.Data.DataSet class..

DataSet(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context): It initializes a new instance of a System.Data.DataSet class that has the given serialization information and context. Here, the parameter info is the data needed to serialize or deserialize an object. The context specifies the source and destination of a given serialized stream.
DataSet(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context, bool ConstructSchema): It initializes a new instance of the System.Data.DataSet class.
