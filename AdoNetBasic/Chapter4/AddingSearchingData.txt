In addition to recipes about the DataRelation, DataSet, DataTable, and DataView classes, this chapter covers topics including:

#### ADO.NET does not provide a way to get the TOP N rows from a
DataTable based on the value of a column in the table. Recipe 4.8
shows how to build a filter on the DataView at runtime to return the TOP N rows.



#### The COMPUTE BY clause returns both summary and detail data in a single
result set from a single SELECT statement. Recipe 4.9 shows how to execute a COMPUTE BY statement and how to navigate the result set.

####  The Shape language uses Data Shaping Services for OLE DB as an
alternative to JOIN and GROUP BY syntax to generate hierarchical result
sets. Recipe 4.10 shows how to use the Shape language to get a
hierarchical result set from SQL Server using the OLE DB .NET data
provider, and how to navigate the result set.

## Executing Common Table Expression (CTE) and recursive queries and
working with the returned result sets is demonstrated and discussed in
Recipes Recipe 4.12 and Recipe 4.13.
